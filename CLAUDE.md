# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new project directory for "directus-marketplace-search" that has been initialized but doesn't contain any source code yet. The project directory only contains Claude Code configuration files.

## Current State

- The project directory is empty except for Claude Code configuration
- No package.json, source files, or build configuration exists yet
- The project appears to be in the initial setup phase

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project with appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm)
2. Set up build tools and development dependencies
3. Create the initial project structure

## Configuration

The project has Claude Code permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` allowing:
- File system operations (find, ls commands)
- Basic bash operations for project setup

## Next Steps

This project needs initial setup and structure. Common next steps would be:
- Initialize package.json
- Set up build tooling
- Create source directory structure
- Configure development dependencies
